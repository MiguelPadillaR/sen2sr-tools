# SEN2SR Tools
This repository provides a list of comprehensive tools and utilities for the usage of the [SEN2SR](https://github.com/ESAOpenSR/SEN2SR.git) neural network super-resolution model, developed by the [ESAOpenSR](https://opensr.eu/) team. This model specializes in upscaling Sentinel-2's 10m/px images up to a x4 times improvement of 2.5m/px.

This package implements a feature to crop a polygon directly from the SR image, useful for close-up satellite observation of agricultural states.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KhaosResearch/sen2sr-tools.git
    cd sen2sr-tools
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment and install all dependencies
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -e .
    ```

## Usage in Python

### Get a SR image

It runs the full workflow, from date and location data to super resolved image. Default `size` is 128 px, and it must be a multiple of 32. Default `bands` are Near-Infrared, Red, Blue, Green and the Scene Classification Layer, that contains cloud density information among others. Cropping a polygon from the image is optional, provided the GeoJSON filepath.

```python
from sen2sr_tools.get_sr_image import get_sr_image

lat = 37.265840
lng = -4.593406 
start_date = "2025-11-1"
end_date = "2025-11-15"
# bands = ["B08", "B02", "B03", "B04", "SCL"]       # Default bands
# size = 128                                        # Default size
# geojson_path = None                               # Default value

sr_filepath = get_sr_image(lat, lng, bands, start_date, end_date)

print(f"SR image successfully downloaded and saved at: {sr_filepath}")
```
### Download CUBO

It serves the requested bands' data directly. It uses the date range to get cloudless (<=1%) images. The `crs` can be provided (i.e, "EPSG:32630"), but it can also be automatically calculated from the `lat` and `lon` arguments. If no requested data was found within the date range, it retries with by expanding it backwards in time.

```python
from sen2sr_tools.get_sr_image import download_sentinel_cubo

lat = 37.265840
lng = -4.593406 
start_date = "2025-11-1"
end_date = "2025-11-15"
# crs = None                                   # Default CRS
# bands = ["B08", "B02", "B03", "B04", "SCL"]  # Default bands
# size = 128                                   # Default size
# cloud_threshold= 0.01                        # Default threshold density
# max_retries = 3                              # Default retries
# retry_days_shift: int = 15                   # Default shift

cloudless_image_data_array, sample_date = download_sentinel_cubo(lat, lon, start_date, end_date):
```
### Crop parcel from image

It crops the polygon from the given TIF file and returns the cropped image as PNG.

```python
from sen2sr_tools.get_sr_image import crop_png_from_tif

raster_path = "path/to/file.tif"
geojson_path = "path/to/polygon.geojson"
date = "2025-11-1"

out_png_path = crop_png_from_tif(raster_path, geojson_path, date)

print(f"Polygon successfully cropped and saved at: {out_png_path}")
```
